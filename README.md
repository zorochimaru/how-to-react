# How To React

This is my personal project to learn and teach how to create React applications. The goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate various techniques and tools to improve your React skills.

## Why Bun?

I chose to use **Bun** as the JavaScript runtime for this project because it is super fast and provides an efficient development experience. Bun's speed and built-in features make it an excellent choice for modern web development.

## Features

- **React Router**: Learn how to implement routing in a React application.
- **React Hook Form**: Understand form handling and validation using React Hook Form and Zod.
- **TanStack Query**: Explore data fetching and caching with TanStack Query.
- **Zustand**: Manage application state using Zustand.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Style the application with utility-first CSS.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **`src/core`**: Contains reusable components, hooks, services, and constants.
- **`src/modules`**: Includes feature-specific modules like `reactRouter`, `reactHookForm`, `tanStackQuery` and etc.
- **`src/styles`**: Contains global styles and animations.
- **`src`**: Entry point and application setup.
